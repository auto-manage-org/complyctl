# NAME

complyctl-openscap-plugin - a plugin which extends the complyctl capabilities to use OpenSCAP.

# DESCRIPTION

The plugin is not meant to be executed directly, it communicates with complyctl via gRPC. It has configurable options that can be configured via a manifest file, complyctl processes the manifest file and sends the configuration values to the plugin. Plugin execution occurs when running the complyctl **generate** and **scan** commands.

When the plugin receives the **generate** command from complyctl, it will generate a tailoring policy file and remediation files for bash, ansible, and imagebuilder. The generated tailoring policy file extends the Datastream profile by overriding rules and variables defined in the assessment-plan.json. The generated files are placed in the **openscap** directory under user workspace.

When the plugin receives the **scan** command from complyctl, it will scan the system with **oscap** and return the observations to complyctl based on **oscap** results. The **scan** command then uses the generated tailoring file to validate the Datastream and Policy by scanning the system to produce observations as OSCAL Assessment Results.

The generated remediation files from complyctl are based on the whole policy, it's not targeted to remediate specific findings. **oscap** could be used to manually generate remediation artifacts only for failed rules based on **oscap** scan result.

# FILES

**/usr/share/complytime/plugins/c2p-openscap-manifest.json**
Default plugin manifest file.

**/etc/complytime/config.d/c2p-openscap-manifest.json**
Optional drop-in manifest file with customized plugin configurations.

# EXAMPLES

The following steps create a remediation Ansible Playbook that contains only the remediations required to align your system with a specific baseline, based on the complyctl scan result.

Step 1: generate a new assessment plan for the specified compliance framework, e.g., anssi_bp28_minimal

$ complyctl plan anssi_bp28_minimal

Suppose the user workspace is ~/complytime, the generated assessment plan file would be ~/complytime/assessment-plan.json.

Step 2: generate PVP policy from the generated assessment plan

$ complyctl generate

With this step, the generated policy file could be found here: ~/complytime/openscap/policy/tailoring_policy.xml.

Step 3: scan environment with assessment plan to get the scan result

$ complyctl scan

After scanning, the generated openscap scan result is in ~/complytime/openscap/results/results.xml.

Step 4: find value of the result ID in scan result file

$ oscap info ~/complytime/openscap/results/results.xml

The result ID in the example would be xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_xccdf_complytime.openscapplugin_profile_anssi_bp28_minimal_complytime.

Step 5: generate a remediation Ansible Playbook based on the scan result

$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type ansible --result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_xccdf_complytime.openscapplugin_profile_anssi_bp28_minimal_complytime --tailoring-file ~/complytime/openscap/policy/tailoring_policy.xml --output output_remediations.yml ~/complytime/openscap/results/results.xml
