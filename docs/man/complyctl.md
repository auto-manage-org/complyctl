# NAME

complyctl - Complyctl CLI perform compliance assessment activities using plugins for different underlying technologies.

# SYNOPSIS

**complyctl** [command] [flags]

# DESCRIPTION

Complyctl CLI leverages OSCAL to perform compliance assessment activities, using plugins for each stage of the lifecycle.

Complyctl can be extended to support desired policy engines (PVPs) by the use of plugins.
The plugin acts as the integration between complyctl and the PVPs native interface.
Each plugin is responsible for converting the policy content described in OSCAL into the input format expected by the PVP.
In addition, the plugin converts the raw results provided by the PVP into the schema used by complyctl to generate OSCAL output.

Plugins communicate with complyctl via gRPC and can be authored using any preferred language. The plugin acts as the gRPC server while the complyctl CLI acts as the client. When a complyctl command is run, it invokes the appropriate method served by the plugin.

Complyctl is built on https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-to-policy-go which provides a flexible plugin framework for leveraging OSCAL with various PVPs.

# EXAMPLES

## Leveraging the info command

Use the `info` command functionality to explore information about controls, rules, and parameters within a framework.

```bash
$ complyctl info anssi_bp28_minimal
# List the controls in the framework

$ complyctl info anssi_bp28_minimal --control <control-id>
# List details about a control and rules used by that control

$ complyctl info anssi_bp28_minimal --rule <rule-id>
# List the parameters used be a specific rule

$ complyctl info anssi_bp28_minimal --parameter <parameter-id>
# See the current set value and valid alternatives for a parameter
```

## Assessment Scoping using the plan command

The `plan` command is used for scoping an OSCAL Assessment Plan. Default scope can be changed via configuration file generated by the `--dry-run` option. The fields of the `config.yml` can be updated to scope controls, rules, and parameters.

```bash
$ complyctl plan anssi_bp28_minimal --dry-run --out config.yml 
# Populate framework-id defaults in config.yml

$ complyctl plan anssi_bp28_minimal --scope-config config.yml  
# Configure plan based on updates made in config.yml
```

## Configuring the Assessment Plan

### Excluding Controls and Rules

Excluding components of the assessment plan works the same way for both controls and rules. To exclude a control from the assessment plan, delete the entire group of YAML keys associated with that `controlId`. Activities associated with that `controlId` will be marked as "skipped" if there are no other controls in scope of the activity.

All rules associated with a controlId are included by default and indicated by the "*" global wildcard. To exclude a rule specific to a controlId, use the `excludeRules` YAML key. To exclude a rule across all controls, use the `globalExcludeRules` YAML key. The `globalExcludeRules` YAML key takes priority over `includeRules` globally.

### Selecting Parameter Values

Parameters of the assessment-plan are grouped by remarks value. To configure the `selectParameters` field, update the second-level YAML key `value` with a valid alternative for the selected parameter. Selecting parameter values in the `selectParameters` field will allow you to update the initial set value for a parameter. If the update to the parameter value is not a valid parameter alternative, the `assessment-plan.json` will not be written and an error will be produced, listing the valid alternatives.

Below is an example `config.yml`. The example excludes the controlId `r30` and uses the `excludeRules` YAML key to exclude `accounts_password_set_max_life_root`. The `globalExcludeRules` YAML key is used to exclude all rules for all controlIds in the `config.yml`. The controlId `r31` has a valid parameter update to `var_password_pam_ucredit` from "1" to "365."

```yaml
frameworkId: anssi_bp28_minimal
includeControls:
#- controlId: r30 # Delete all fields associated with r30
#  controlTitle: Removal Of Unused User Accounts
#  includeRules:
#  - "*"
#  selectParameters:
#  - name: N/A
#    value: N/A
- controlId: r31
  controlTitle: User Password Strength
  includeRules:
  - "*"
  excludeRules: # Use to exclude a rule specific to the controlId
  - "accounts_password_set_max_life_root"
  waiveRules: # Use to waive a rule specific to the controlId
  - "accounts_password_pam_minlen"
  selectParameters:
  - name: var_password_pam_ucredit # Initial value = "1"
    value: "365" # Update parameter value to a valid alternative ("365")
  - name: var_password_pam_unix_rounds
    value: "11" # Initial value = "11"
globalExcludeRules:
- "*" # This will exclude all rules for all controlIds
globalWaiveRules:
- "*" # This will waive all rules for all controlIds
```

## Assessment Plan Scope Inheritance

When excluding a `controlId` from the `config.yml`, the initial "*" `includeRules` values will be skipped and not assessed for the `controlId` in the assessment plan. 

The activities of the assessment plan will be indicated as "skipped" for rules that are globally excluded. Therefore, all parameters associated with a globally excluded rule will not be used in the generated `assessment-plan.json`.

When waiving a rule, the initial "*" `includeRules` values will be checked for the rule indicated in `waiveRules`. If the rule is included, it will be marked as "waived" in the Assessment Plan. The rule will be expected to fail due to any known exception related to the environment being scanned. 

The output in `assessment-results.md` will reflect the `Waived Rules` within the `Failed Rules` section. In the case of a rule unexpectedly passing, it will be included in the `Passed Rules` section. 

The activities of the assessment plan will be indicated as "waived" for rules that are globally waived. Therefore, all parameters associated with a globally waived rule will not be altered in the generated `assessment-plan.json`.

After configuring the `assessment-plan.json` the activities of the assessment plan and their selected parameter values will be updated.
